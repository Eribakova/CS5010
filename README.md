# CS5010 Final Project




## BikeShare Data Analysis comarping pre-covid and post-covid

### Introduction

We wanted to explore some idea on how people's social behavior changed with covid. Our focus is on a change of trend in bikesharing. Here are some example questions we thought to find out:

1. Did the number of trips change from pre-COVID and post-COVID?
2. Did any COVID even change the bikeshare frequency?
3. Comaprison between suburb area and city area.


### Introducing our DATASET

We got our dataset from 'Capital Bikshare', from following webseite: https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data
For our project, we concatenated monthly dataset from Februrary 2019 to Februrary 2021. We then filled out missing values such as 'lat' and 'long' since dataset before covid did that have that information. We then extracted State from lat/long information then decided to use final dataset with records only from 'Virginia'.

## BikeShare Data Analysis comarping pre-covid and post-covid

### Introduction

We wanted to explore some idea on how people's social behavior changed with covid. Our focus is on a change of trend in bikesharing. Here are some example questions we thought to find out:

1. Did the number of trips change from pre-COVID and post-COVID?
2. Did any COVID even change the bikeshare frequency?
3. Comaprison between suburb area and city area.
